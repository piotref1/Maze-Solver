# Maze-Solver
Solving and designing maze with 1 wide corridors using modified right hand method.

Written with SFML and C++. Tilemap display is taken from the SFML tutorial.
No material was used for the algorithm as I just based it on rule of right hand aka "If you can go right first go right.".
Due to that algorithm may be clunky as it was written from scratch.


Manual:
Press L to load saved maze layout. 
Press SPACE to start algorithm to solve maze. 
Press S to save current design.

TODO:
Add text to window "Manual" with above text.
Redo the backtracking with list or way for it to solve open rooms. Currently works for some designs.
